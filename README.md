# Form Input Wave Demo

This demo is made while following [an amazing tutorial](https://youtu.be/HtunPQtr-Xw) made by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia). It demonstrates an easy way to animate the input labels to have a wave effect upwards when clicking in an input field.

### Screenshots
